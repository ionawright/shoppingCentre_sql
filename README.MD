## COURSEWORK SPEC

###### You are asked to implement and document the development of a database solution for a shopping centres app. A database is required to store shopping centre details including shops. Each of the 6 shopping centre has a unique code, a name, a location and a set of shops. A shop is identified by a number and has a name (10 shops are required). 


#### INSTRUCTIONS (Mac):


###### 1. Download XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) 

###### 2. Check manager-osx to ensure apache is running - if not this is to do with the port provided. Try updating to something different from what is already in use (I changed it to port 9000). If that doesn't work, go to your terminal and type in the command `sudo apachectl stop`. 

###### 3. Once XAMPP is running it will open up in a browser, in the top right corner click on phpMyadmin. ( TODO: add the process for setting up a password with mysql).

###### 4. Go to http://localhost:9000/phpmyadmin (or whatever port you have specified) to create your database.
